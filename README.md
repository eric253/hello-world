This is the beginning
I've never messed with code, but I am fascinated by the possibility of creating new tools to make my industry more productive. I do that through a combination of existing tools and automation at the moment, but I would love to design these myself to increase my productivity of making workflows more productive and meaningful for future utilizations.
